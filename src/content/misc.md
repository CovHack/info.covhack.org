You can find the full list of hardware MLH has [here](/MLH_Hardware.pdf),
including all the sensors and components normally not listed on
[hardware.mlh.io](https://hardware.mlh.io/). This is also printed out and
available at the hardware lab!


If you have an open source project and are looking for contributors, let a team
member know! We'll give you a shout out on our screens and the slack.
