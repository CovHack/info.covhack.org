To handle project submissions this weekend, we are using [Devpost](https://covhack2020.devpost.com/). You can submit them to [covhack2020.devpost.com](https://covhack2020.devpost.com/). Submissions close at 11am, but you can continue hacking til 12. (Just a logistical thing!)

We are judging projects based on how much you learnt, built and shared. We really want to know what you learnt during your project and really want you to share it with us!

Everyone will get to demo their project in ECG-24. We realise it can be quite nerve wracking to demo like this, but it's a really good way of improving your public speaking!

Tips for demoing:

* Skip the slide deck, you only have 3 minutes to demo.
* Show us what you made, even if it doesn't work properly.
* Tell us what was hard to do, how you resolved the issue, etc.
* A good Devpost submission makes it easier for the judges to reference back

Technical information about demos can be found [here](https://will-russell.com/covhack2020).

Clarity on rules can be found here. Please don't submit anything that would violate our code of conduct!
