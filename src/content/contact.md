If you need to get hold of an organiser, the core team are wearing CovHack
hoodies while the volunteers all have CovHack t-shirts. Both have rainbow
lanyards.

On slack, we all have CovHack Emoji in our statuses.

The team can be reached at hello@covhack.org

If you need to report an incident (harassment, etc) you can:

* Email incidents@mlh.io
* Talk to Aaron Osher at the MLH table.
* Talk to any of the core organisers.
