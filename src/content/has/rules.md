* Donâ€™t smoke near the building
* Sign in when you enter/leave the building. So we know who is in the building if we have to evacuate.
* Do not try to get in doors that do not open
* No soldering
* Let us know of any medical conditions that we may need to know about! This allows us to respond better!
* Don't mess with our infrastructure with out talking to us. We're fine with creative hacks, just don't go knocking the wifi offline, etc:
