There are a few options for getting internet access at the event. As always, if you need help with anything please talk to a member of the team.

We recommend you use `PHOENIX-NET` or `eduroam` as they offer the most security and best signal strength around the venue. The CovHack specific networks are meant to offer network access for IoT projects and those without eduroam, and all devices on them are on the same VLAN.
