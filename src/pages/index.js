                We recommend you use <code>PHOENIX-NET</code> or <code>eduroam</code> as they offer the
                most security and best signal strength around the venue.
                
                The CovHack specific networks are meant to offer network access
                for IoT projects and those without eduroam, and all devices on
                them are on the same VLAN.

              <p>
                To handle project submissions this weekend, we are using Devpost.
                Submissions close at 11am, but you can continue hacking til 12.
                (Just a logistical thing!)
              </p>
              <p>
                We are judging projects based on how much you <b>learnt, built
                and shared</b>. We really want to know what you learnt during
                your project and really want you to share it with us!
              </p>
              <p>
                Everyone will get to demo their project in ECG-24. We realise
                it can be quite nerve wracking to demo like this, but it's
                a really good way of improving your public speaking!
              </p>
              <p>
                Tips for demoing:
                <ul>
                  <li>Skip the slide deck, you only have a few minutes to demo.</li>
                  <li>Tell us what was hard to do, how you resolved the issue, etc.</li>
                  <li>A good devpost submission makes it easier for the judges to reference back</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
