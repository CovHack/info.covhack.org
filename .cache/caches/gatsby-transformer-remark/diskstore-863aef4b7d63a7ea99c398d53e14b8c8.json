Submissions close at 11am, but you can continue hacking til 12. (Just a logistical thing!)</p>\n<p>We are judging projects based on how much you learnt, built and shared. We really want to know what you learnt during your project and really want you to share it with us!</p>\n<p>Everyone will get to demo their project in ECG-24. We realise it can be quite nerve wracking to demo like this, but it's a really good way of improving your public speaking!</p>\n<p>Tips for demoing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skip the slide deck, you only have a few minutes to demo.</li>\n<li>Tell us what was hard to do, how you resolved the issue, etc.</li>\n<li>A good devpost submission makes it easier for the judges to reference back</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clarity on rules can be found here. Please don't submit anything that would violate our code of conduct!</p>"}
